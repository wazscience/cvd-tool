# CVD Tool Fixes Guide

This document provides instructions for addressing the remaining ESLint issues in the CVD-Tool project.

## Completed Fixes

The automatic fix script has addressed the following critical issues:

1. ✅ Fixed CryptoJS undefined references in encryption-wrapper.js
2. ✅ Fixed unused exports in utility modules
3. ✅ Created modern ESLint configuration
4. ✅ Fixed unterminated template in fix-pdf-preview.js
5. ✅ Fixed 'return' outside of function in add-loading-indicators.js
6. ✅ Fixed duplicate function declarations
7. ✅ Fixed syntax errors in various JS files
8. ✅ Created proper package.json with modern dependencies
9. ✅ Created .gitignore file

## Remaining Issues

The following issues should be addressed manually:

### 1. No-Loss-of-Precision Errors in QRISK3 Implementation

These errors occur because some numeric literals in the QRISK3 algorithm are too large for JavaScript to represent precisely. To fix:

- Add BigDecimal or similar library for precise arithmetic
- Implement alternative representations for large numbers
- Add `// eslint-disable-next-line no-loss-of-precision` before affected lines if precision is acceptable

### 2. Unused Variables

Search for warnings like `'x' is defined but never used` and fix by:
- Removing unused variables if they're unnecessary
- Using the variables where appropriate
- Prefixing unused parameters with underscore (e.g., `_event`)

```javascript
// Before
function handleClick(event) {
  console.log('clicked');
}

// After
function handleClick(_event) {
  console.log('clicked');
}
```

### 3. Undefined Browser Globals

Warnings about Node, Element, and URL being undefined can be fixed by:
- Adding appropriate type definitions or polyfills
- The ESLint config has been updated to recognize these globals
- Ensure the code gracefully handles their absence in environments where they're unavailable

### 4. Brace Style Errors

Fix by ensuring consistent brace placement:

```javascript
// Incorrect
if (condition)
{
  doSomething();
}
else
{
  doSomethingElse();
}

// Correct
if (condition) {
  doSomething();
} else {
  doSomethingElse();
}
```

## Testing Your Fixes

After making changes, run the ESLint check:

```bash
npm install
npx eslint .
```

## Next Steps

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Fix remaining issues systematically
3. Run ESLint with `npx eslint .` to verify fixes
4. Run the build process: `npm run build`
5. Test the application thoroughly to ensure functionality
